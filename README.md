This is a python program I've developed for my Vacation Research Experience Scheme (VRES) project at QUT.
My mentors Dr. Surasak and Prof. Yi-Chin work in the Micro-Tissue Engineering Lab, and have projects within the field of advance 3D cell culture.
Electrochemical Aptamer-based (EAB) sensors was introduced to one of their focus testing subject. 
The continuous monitoring of the EAB sensors generates a large amount of data, and the data processing procedures was previously done manually.
My VRES projects had delivered this python program with the following objectives:
1. automate the entire data processing operation
2. include features for user to identify and eliminate faulty data
3. search for alternative smoothing function that performs more reliably compared to the in-built Fourier Transform function previously used.

Please read the User Manual of the program before operating the program! Good Luck!!
